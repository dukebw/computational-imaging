\section{Contribution}

Ng et al.\ contributed a system (Handheld Plenoptic Camera) for taking 4D light field photographs.
Their main contribution was their design and experimental verification of a
handheld plenopic camera that they actually built.
Handheld Plenoptic Camera is built from a main lens, microlens array, and photosensor.
Ng et al.\ described their choices in Handheld Plenoptic Camera's design space.
For example, they matched main lens and microlens $f$-numbers in order to
maximize the sensor image under each microlens without overlapping.
They provided a detailed description of the specifications of their image
sensor, microlens array, camera body, and lenses, and justified these choices.
The detailed description of the Handheld Plenoptic Camera prototype would
provide pioneering guidance to industry practitioners interested in implementing light field cameras.
Furthermore, Handheld Plenoptic Camera's design improves over existing work at
the time, since it was designed to have the same user experience (interface) as
a conventional camera.
Finally, Ng et al.\ provided an optical design and associated algorithms for integrating light passing through the aperture.
They verified experimentally that their design improves signal-to-noise ratio compared to conventional photography with the same depth of field and exposure time.


\section{Extension}

Ng et al.\ make an interesting remark (\S 8) that 4D light field images create an interesting interactive component.
They said that friends and colleagues enjoyed being able to play with the focus
digitally, or change the viewpoint interactively.
However, most consumer cameras are in smartphones.
I am not sure whether manufacturers could include the same design as Handheld Plenoptic Camera in their smartphone cameras ---
they may be limited by cost or form factor.
Instead, we could use Handheld Plenoptic Camera to create a dataset of ground truth focus/refocus images.
This dataset could be used to train a fully digital refocusing algorithm (e.g., a convolutional neural network).
That way, the refocusing ability could be made more widely available in
smartphone cameras. The digital refocusing quality should still be high due to the high accuracy of the dataset used for training the algorithm.
